# Homepage

## What it is

Homepage (project `gethomepage/homepage`) is a static dashboard for homelabs: services, links and live widgets are rendered from YAML files under `config/`. The application runs as a Next.js container, ships **without a database** and has **no login of its own** – access protection is handled by the reverse proxy.

## Notable ideas

_To do: what does this program do that others don't? Why is it documented here (ADR 0013)?_
