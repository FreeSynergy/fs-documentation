## What it is

Proxmox VE is an open-source virtualisation platform based on Debian: KVM/QEMU virtual machines and LXC containers are operated through a shared web UI (port 8006, HTTPS) – optionally as a cluster with Ceph, replication and high availability. The full feature set is accessible via the REST API (`/api2/json`) with ticket or token authentication.

## Notable ideas

_To do: what does this program do that others don't? Why is it documented here (ADR 0013)?_
