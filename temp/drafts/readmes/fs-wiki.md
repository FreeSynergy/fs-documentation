# FreeSynergy Wiki — write and know together

**Every text you write is a page you can find, link and keep, and the database is the truth, not a pile of files.**

FreeSynergy Wiki turns texts into connected pages. Pages link to each other, and you can see what links to a page. Move a page or a whole folder and the links that pointed at it follow. Search finds words in titles, paths and content.

What is different here: a text is stored as text plus layers, not as one flat file. You can import a folder of Markdown files, edit in the program, and export Markdown again when you decide to. Saving is not exporting: nothing is written to your files until you press Export. If both the file and the database changed, the program shows you the conflict instead of overwriting either. This program owns the open text interface, so other programs can reach texts through one interface instead of keeping their own text model.

## What it can do today

Latest tag: `v0.3.0`.

- Create, edit, move, delete and list texts by path; links, backlinks and search.
- Move a text or a folder and rewrite the links to it.
- Import Markdown (a changed file becomes ordinary edits) and export Markdown.
- Refuse an overwrite when someone else saved first.
- Tell other programs when a text changes.
- A small server that offers all of this over a local socket.
- A first window, the reader: a tree of pages, reading with formatting, following links, back, search, editing and saving, and an explicit Export button. Unsaved drafts are backed up and offered back after a crash.
- The first start imports a documentation folder (about 30 seconds for 1,400 pages).

## What is not there yet

- Typing in the real window has not been verified by tests; the DESIGN file lists what to try by hand.
- No other editors, no collections or shelves, no templates inside the program.
- The edit lock works inside one process. Two programs on the same store file are not covered.
- Some characters (certain emoji) show as boxes, and very wide tables can run past the edge.
- The interface is a draft with no consumer yet.

## Part of FreeSynergy

Wiki is where texts live for the groupware, project-management and democracy suites. FreeSynergy is a family of programs that are free for everyone, forever, and that keep your data yours. The documentation, the manifesto and the overall plan live in [fs-documentation](https://github.com/FreeSynergy/fs-documentation); the reading version is at <https://freesynergy.github.io/fs-documentation/>. Start with the [manifesto](https://freesynergy.github.io/fs-documentation/en/manifesto/) if you want to know why we do this.


## For developers

- Workspace crates: `fs-text` (library for text and layers, no storage), `fs-wiki-core` (the `Texts` trait and its store-backed implementation), `fs-wiki-server` (contract over a Unix socket), `fs-wiki-app` (the reader window, on [fs-components](https://github.com/FreeSynergy/fs-components)).
- The contract is `texts.capnp` in [fs-interfaces](https://github.com/FreeSynergy/fs-interfaces) (draft). Wiki owns it.
- Build and test: `cargo build --workspace` and `cargo test --workspace`. Try the core: `cargo run -p fs-wiki-core --example manifesto`.
- Design and the full state table: [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).
